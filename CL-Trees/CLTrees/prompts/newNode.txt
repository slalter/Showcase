Given a set of existing_generalized_steps and a specific_task, create a new generalized_step to fit the specific_task.

Your new generalized_step should be approximately the same level of generalization as the existing_generalized_steps.
Your new generalized_step should be similar in length, specificity, and other attributes to the existing_generalized_steps.
The specific_task is the most recent task that was completed towards the overall_goal.

existing_generalized_steps: $existing_generalized_steps

specific_task: $specific_task

overall_goal: $overall_goal

respond with a json as follows:
{
    "new_generalized_step": (your generalized description.)
}
