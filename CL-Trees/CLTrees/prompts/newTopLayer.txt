You are summarizing the current progress in task described in task_description. 
Your job is to take the existing_substeps and express the same process in fewer general_steps.


You must meet the following constraints:
1. The number of general_steps you provide must be at least 2 and at most $max_steps.
2. All existing_substeps must be mapped to a general_step.
3. All general_steps must have at least one individual_step.
4. The chronology of the existing_substeps must be preserved in your general_steps.
5. Your general_steps must be chronological with respect to the provided timestamps.
6. The union of your general_steps, in the order you provide them, MUST be equivalent to the original list. You may NOT rearrange the objects.
7. Do not include TimeRanges or timestamps in your response.

/$DEBUGGING_MODE

Respond with a JSON as follows:
{
    (general_step_description):[list of existing_substeps mapped to this general_step],
    (next_general_step_description):[list of existing_substeps mapped to this general_step]
    ... and so on.
