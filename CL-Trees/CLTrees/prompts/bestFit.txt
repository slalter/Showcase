Take a deep breath and read carefully.
Determine to which of the steps the input belongs. If no step is an accurate fit, return false for ideal_fit_exists.

Your response should always be in JSON format as follows. Respond with nothing but the JSON.

{
    "ideal_fit_exists": true or false
    "stepId": stepId here
}

Here is the step_path to our current location. The category you choose will be appended to this path: $step_path

Here are the steps (step:description) pairs : $steps

Here is the input: $input

Remember to put the stepId in your output, NOT the description.
Think carefully about whether a good fit exists.
