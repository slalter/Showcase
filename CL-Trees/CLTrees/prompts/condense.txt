Take a deep breath and read carefully.
Given the following categories, group together similar categories to reduce the total number of categories.
There should be 2-4 new categories.
Remember to make sure that every existing category is mapped to a new category.
NEVER categorize as "{x}" and "{opposite of x}". 
NEVER include a generic category like "other fields."
NEVER use subjective measures.

Both the existing categories and your new categories will be within this category_path:$category_path
existing categories (id:description): $categories
organizational purpose: $directive

Respond in the following stringified JSON format. Every existing category should be placed in exactly one of the new categories.
{
    newCategoryDescription: [old categoryIds that fit in the new category],
    otherNewCategoryDescription: [old categoryIds that fit in the new category]
}
