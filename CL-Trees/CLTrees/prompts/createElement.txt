Your job is to take the input_data and provide the following fields:
task_name: a description of what occurred in the task in fewer than 5 words. This should be as specific as possible.
task_summary: a more detailed description of what occurred in the task, fewer than 2 paragraphs. Do not explain relevance, simply describe the process as succinctly as possible.
relevant_data: any relevant data from the task that may need to be accessed in the future. Include a description of how to interpret the data, if necessary.

here is the data:
$data

You do not need to concern yourself with the rules, regulations, or instructions themselves as provided in the data.
Instead, focus on what tasks have been accomplished and the details of those tasks.

Respond with a JSON containing the fields described above.

$DEBUGGING_MODE
Additionally, include a field called 'notes' that explains your reasoning, describes anything that was especially difficult to do, and provides recommendations for clearer instructions, if applicable.
