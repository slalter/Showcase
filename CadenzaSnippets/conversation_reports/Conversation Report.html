Number of people served by the project: Project Description Cost of Project # of People Served Cost per Participant To provide seizure monitoring devices for children with epilepsy $376,000 525 $500 Projected goals and outcomes Our primary project goal is to save the lives of children who cope with epilepsy by enabling intervention when a seizure takes place. A tributary outcome is reducing the stress and anxiety among epilepsy parents and caregivers, who will feel more confident to rest, knowing an alerting system is in place. In addition, another project goal is to obtain data on health disparities to guide an expansion of DDFs educational outreach and device grant program to reduce health disparities in pediatric epilepsy care. The project also addresses one of our key priorities: addressing inequities in healthcare. As a recent example, our history of device grant data will be featured during a conference hosted by the International League Against Epilepsy, to provide insights into epilepsy device use in the United States. Our device program will (1) identify the location, and demographic profile of families and children coping with epilepsy in greater Chicago who are in need of monitoring support; (2) collect information from our grantee families to understand what barriers exist to accessing care and provision of resources, and to work to co-create educational resources that are culturally relevant, accessible, and meaningful; (3) work with community health providers, community leaders, and schools to make families aware of and facilitate access to our seizure-detection device grant program; Success for Danny Did would be to provide seizure monitoring devices for every family that needs one, so that no family loses a child to a seizure. Our goal 2024 is to provide device funding to more than 600 families, continuing a steady annual increase over the past several years. Success is also fulfilling many families dreams of independence, a secure nights sleep, and a drastically improved quality of life. We evaluate the programs success annually based on volume of grants, and survey feedback from grantees, using lessons learned to make improvements and sustainable adaptations to program delivery for children with epilepsy.'}, {'result_no': 1, 'FileName': '2305_App_HANDY_notes.pdf', 'FilePath': 'sharepoint/Cadenza Internal/Documents/Grant Applications/Q3/2305_App_HANDY_notes.pdf', 'Content': "resources available are lacking and not the same as those in foster care. These caregivers often face substantial hardships, legal barriers, and difficulty accessing benefits when taking on the responsibility of this youth. 11.7% of these caregivers are living below the Federal Poverty Level with nearly a quarter having a disability. Caregivers are often on a fixed income with chronic health needs, limiting the ability to keep up with the educational, social, and emotional needs of the grandchild. Research suggests that without the extended support most families provide young people in the transition to adulthood, youth leaving foster care face enormous challenges in building successful lives. In general, they are not as well prepared educationally, have a harder time embarking on a productive career, are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to be involved with the legal system. Many do not graduate from high school and only approximately 1% attends college. As a result, it is estimated that former foster youth make up 10% of Florida's homeless population. With such daunting statistics, it becomes imperative to provide this population with the extra means to become self-sufficient. In addition, they are battling economic disparity. 100% of HANDY client live at or below 100% of the poverty rate. In addition, 100% of our youth are active survivors of childhood trauma; more than 70% are still living through their trauma moments while enrolled in our program. Data shows that foster youth are more likely to than their peers to experience a host of barriers that lead to troubling outcomes, including low academic achievement, grade retention, and lower high school graduation rates. The goal of HANDYs program is to do anything in the power of the organization to ensure our young people are in programs that provide them with the opportunities to receive the support and resources needed to be successful.

Number of people served by the project: Project Description Cost of Project # of People Served Cost per Participant To provide seizure monitoring devices for children with epilepsy $376,000 525 $500 Projected goals and outcomes Our primary project goal is to save the lives of children who cope with epilepsy by enabling intervention when a seizure takes place. A tributary outcome is reducing the stress and anxiety among epilepsy parents and caregivers, who will feel more confident to rest, knowing an alerting system is in place. In addition, another project goal is to obtain data on health disparities to guide an expansion of DDFs educational outreach and device grant program to reduce health disparities in pediatric epilepsy care. The project also addresses one of our key priorities: addressing inequities in healthcare. As a recent example, our history of device grant data will be featured during a conference hosted by the International League Against Epilepsy, to provide insights into epilepsy device use in the United States. Our device program will (1) identify the location, and demographic profile of families and children coping with epilepsy in greater Chicago who are in need of monitoring support; (2) collect information from our grantee families to understand what barriers exist to accessing care and provision of resources, and to work to co-create educational resources that are culturally relevant, accessible, and meaningful; (3) work with community health providers, community leaders, and schools to make families aware of and facilitate access to our seizure-detection device grant program; Success for Danny Did would be to provide seizure monitoring devices for every family that needs one, so that no family loses a child to a seizure. Our goal 2024 is to provide device funding to more than 600 families, continuing a steady annual increase over the past several years. Success is also fulfilling many families dreams of independence, a secure nights sleep, and a drastically improved quality of life. We evaluate the programs success annually based on volume of grants, and survey feedback from grantees, using lessons learned to make improvements and sustainable adaptations to program delivery for children with epilepsy.\'}, {\'result_no\': 1, \'FileName\': \'2305_App_HANDY_notes.pdf\', \'FilePath\': \'sharepoint/Cadenza Internal/Documents/Grant Applications/Q3/2305_App_HANDY_notes.pdf\', \'Content\': \\"resources available are lacking and not the same as those in foster care. These caregivers often face substantial hardships, legal barriers, and difficulty accessing benefits when taking on the responsibility of this youth. 11.7% of these caregivers are living below the Federal Poverty Level with nearly a quarter having a disability. Caregivers are often on a fixed income with chronic health needs, limiting the ability to keep up with the educational, social, and emotional needs of the grandchild. Research suggests that without the extended support most families provide young people in the transition to adulthood, youth leaving foster care face enormous challenges in building successful lives. In general, they are not as well prepared educationally, have a harder time embarking on a productive career, are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to be involved with the legal system. Many do not graduate from high school and only approximately 1% attends college. As a result, it is estimated that former foster youth make up 10% of Florida\'s homeless population. With such daunting statistics, it becomes imperative to provide this population with the extra means to become self-sufficient. In addition, they are battling economic disparity. 100% of HANDY client live at or below 100% of the poverty rate. In addition, 100% of our youth are active survivors of childhood trauma; more than 70% are still living through their trauma moments while enrolled in our program. Data shows that foster youth are more likely to than their peers to experience a host of barriers that lead to troubling outcomes, including low academic achievement, grade retention, and lower high school graduation rates. The goal of HANDYs program is to do anything in the power of the organization to ensure our young people are in programs that provide them with the opportunities to receive the support and resources needed to be successful.

In addition, another project goal is to obtain data on health disparities to guide an expansion of DDFs educational outreach and device grant program to reduce health disparities in pediatric epilepsy care. The project also addresses one of our key priorities: addressing inequities in healthcare. As a recent example, our history of device grant data will be featured during a conference hosted by the International League Against Epilepsy, to provide insights into epilepsy device use in the United States. Our device program will (1) identify the location, and demographic profile of families and children coping with epilepsy in greater Chicago who are in need of monitoring support; (2) collect information from our grantee families to understand what barriers exist to accessing care and provision of resources, and to work to co-create educational resources that are culturally relevant, accessible, and meaningful; (3) work with community health providers, community leaders, and schools to make families aware of and facilitate access to our seizure-detection device grant program; Success for Danny Did would be to provide seizure monitoring devices for every family that needs one, so that no family loses a child to a seizure. Our goal 2024 is to provide device funding to more than 600 families, continuing a steady annual increase over the past several years. Success is also fulfilling many families dreams of independence, a secure nights sleep, and a drastically improved quality of life.

This school year, 88% of students we are reaching through our combined programs are Black or Latine. As previously mentioned, across our school partners in the current school year 2023-2024, 77% of students come from economically disadvantaged households. Today, there are more obstacles on the path to high school graduation than prior to COVID-19. Our program model is responsive to the needs of students and is proven to help students stay in school and achieve graduation. An investment from The Foundation will help us support students and provide them with crucial resources, so that they are poised to persist on their academic journeys, flourish in their lives, and realize their full potential.
