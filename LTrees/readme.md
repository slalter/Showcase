This is a module for dynamically-sorted categorical trees. There are quite a few things I have used this for. Here are a couple examples:
1. dynamic job matching, where the current state of the treeNavigator is fed to the LLM so that the LLM knows what kinds of questions to ask
2. categorical/parameterized RAG, where non-leaf nodes represent categories of documents and embeddings are dynamically created based on use_cases

There is a lot of potential work to be done here, including performing much more of the process computationally via embedding comparisons.
There is a decent amount of overlap with one of the key ideas in Microsoft's GraphRAG (the clustering and up-summarizing is functionally the same, but they built it on top of a traditional knowledge graph)
