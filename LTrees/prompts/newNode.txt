call_type: json_response_sync
----
Your job is to look at the existing categories and create an additional category to fit the new input. 
The new category should be disjoint from the existing categories.
NEVER use subjective criteria in your categorization.

Your response should always be in JSON format as follows. Respond with nothing but the JSON.

{
    "newCategory": your new category description here
}

input: $input

existing categories: $categories

The existing categories, as well as your new category, are sub-categories of this category_path: $category_path

sorting purpose: $directive

Think carefully to make sure that your new category is COMPLETELY disjoint from the existing categories.
