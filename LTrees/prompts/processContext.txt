Use the given information to determine how likely each category is to have the best match.

information: $information

categories: $categories

Respond with a stringified python list containing decimal weights on [0,1] that represent how likely the corresponding category is to contain the information you are looking for. Your weights are mapped to the categories based on their position in the list.
The weights don't need to sum to 1. 
If it seems like it would be better to gather more information before proceeding, simply return an empty list instead. 
It is always better to gather more information than to proceed with any degree of uncertainty.
Respond with just the stringified python list and nothing more.
