----
Given the existing_categories, come up with between $min_new_cats and $max_new_cats new non-empty super_categories that contain the existing_categories.
Each of the existing_categories must be mapped to exactly one of the super_categories, with no duplication. No existing_categories may be ommited.
NEVER categorize as "{x}" and "{opposite of x}". 
NEVER include a generic category like "other fields."
Whenever possible, avoid making categories that are simply 'X + Y' to summarize categories X and Y. 
Instead, come up with original super_categories that represent a commonality between some subset of the existing_categories.

Both the existing categories and your new categories will be within this category_path:$category_path
existing_categories (id:description): $categories
organizational purpose: You are sorting according to $directive

Respond in the following stringified JSON format. Every existing category should be placed in exactly one of the new categories.
{
    newCategoryDescription: [old categoryIds that fit in the new category],
    otherNewCategoryDescription: [old categoryIds that fit in the new category],
    ...
}
