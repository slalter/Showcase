Implementation Decision: Duplication of Code Objects Across Project States

Current Strategy:
-----------------
We are currently duplicating each code object (Model, Main, Method, TestCase) across different project states in the database.
This approach has been adopted to simplify querying and indexing, allowing us to easily fetch and compare code objects
that are active within a specific project state. This strategy ensures high performance in querying by project state, 
critical for operations like vector similarity checks, without complex joins or aggregations.

Trade-offs:
-----------
The primary trade-off with this approach is increased storage usage due to the duplication of code objects, especially 
when many project states share identical code. While this increases database size, it significantly simplifies the 
database schema and query patterns, which can be beneficial for performance and ease of maintenance in the early stages 
of development.

Next Steps - Transitioning to a Hybrid Approach:
-----------------------------------------------
As the application scales and storage constraints become more pronounced, we might consider transitioning to a hybrid 
database schema. This approach would involve:

1. Normalizing Immutable Attributes:
   - Extract and centralize immutable attributes of code objects (e.g., the actual code content) into a single table. 
     Each unique piece of code would be stored once, reducing redundancy.

2. Storing Mutable Attributes Separately:
   - Maintain mutable attributes or state-specific metadata (e.g., descriptions, annotations, specific configurations) 
     in separate tables linked to both the central code table and project states. This allows these attributes to vary 
     with project iterations without duplicating the core content.

3. Implementing Partitioned or Filtered Indexes:
   - Use advanced database features like partitioned or filtered indexes to maintain high query performance, 
     specifically tailored to efficiently access the relevant states of code objects within the context of specific 
     project states.

This hybrid model strikes a balance between normalization and performance, minimizing redundancy while maintaining 
quick access to relevant data. It will require careful planning and implementation to ensure data integrity and 
efficient access patterns are preserved.

Implications for Future Development:
------------------------------------
When moving to a hybrid model:
- Database migrations will be necessary to split the existing tables and redistribute the data appropriately.
- Update the application logic to handle the split between immutable content and mutable attributes.
- Consideration must be given to how version control of the code objects is handled within this new schema, 
  potentially integrating more complex versioning logic into the application.

This planned transition should be reviewed periodically to assess its necessity based on actual storage costs, 
performance metrics, and development complexity.

Types of Code Objects:
----------------------
- Model: Represents a model that encapsulates data within the project's psql db.
- Method: Represents individual methods or functions within a larger codebase.
- TestCase: Represents test cases for validating the functionality of the codebase.

Each type is currently treated as an independent entity within each project state, fully duplicated even if unchanged. 
This facilitates isolated enhancements and versioning specific to project requirements."
