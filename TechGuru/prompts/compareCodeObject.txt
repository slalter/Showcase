----
A new {{ $object_type }} has been requested, but first we need to make sure we aren't rebuilding something we already have.

Here is the method that was requested:
requested_method: {{ $requested_method_description }}
{% if requested_method_output %}
requested_method_output: {{ $requested_method_output }}
{% endif %}
{% if requested_method_input %}
requested_method_input: {{ $requested_method_input }}
{% endif %}

Here are the closest things we already have:
{% for i in $matches %}
#{{ loop.index }}:
    description: {{ i['description'] }}
    input: {{ i['input'] }}
    output: {{ i['output'] }}
{% endfor %}


Respond with a json as follows:
{
    'similar_method_numbers':[method_numbers] ### A list of method_numbers for existing methods that are similar enough that they might already encompass a significant part of the required functionality.
}
