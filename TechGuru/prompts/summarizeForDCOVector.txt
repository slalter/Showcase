Prompt:

You are working in a system that determines how detailed the context provided to an agent will be. This is done with a tree structure where child nodes contain data that is a subset of their parent node's data, with a higher degree of detail. Your job is to assist in determining when we should use the greater detail from a child node instead of using the parent node.

Task:
{% if $parent_data %}
Briefly describe how the child_data differs from the parent_data with respect to the given_topic. Focus on how the child_data provides more specific or detailed information regarding the given_topic. Use the knowledge of the parent_data, but only describe the child_data. Avoid unnecessary words or phrases, maintaining a high density of meaningful words.
{%endif%}

{%if not $parent_data %}
This is a top-level node without a parent.
Briefly describe how the data relates to the given_topic. Focus on what information is provided regarding the given_topic. Avoid unnecessary words or phrases, maintaining a high density of meaningful words.
{%endif%}

given_topic:
{{ $given_topic }}

{%if $parent_data%}
parent_data:
{{ $parent_data }}

child_data:
{{ $child_data }}
{%endif%}
{%if not $parent_data %}
data:
{{$child_data}}
{%endif%}
