# Welcome!

In these folders, you'll find some of my recent projects, with sensitive info redacted and proprietary packages removed. Everything is built from the ground up.

## Early Projects

- **AIQualifier**: A simple SMS bot for qualifying leads with GPT-3.5.
- **AIQABot**: A system to use LLMs to automatically categorize and summarize Retreaver calls.

## Experimental/Theoretical Projects

- **L-Trees**: A dynamic, LLM-powered categorizational tree algorithm from my time with NewSeat. It was used for pairing candidates with jobs by using the tree's state to assist the LLM in asking the right questions to guide users to existing job postings.
- **CL-Trees**: A chronological version of L-Trees, designed for memory.
- **ProjectionComparison**: Some small NLP experiments.

## Fullstack Projects

- **a3e-google-cloud**: A Flask app for a client.

## Most Recent Projects

- **TechGuru**: An app that aims to automatically implement strong typing via LLMs + Pyright, build test cases, and ultimately build entire applications in a traceable and verifiable manner.
  - The most impressive aspects are probably in the database design and the most recent state of my guru package and the features in `features/`.
    - **DynamicContextObjects**: The abstraction of L-Trees and CL-Trees, built on pgvector.
    - **guru package**: An abstraction around conversations that I have been building up over time. As you will see, I often incorporate existing technologies into this framework - it's the level of abstraction that provides the value.

## CadenzaSnippets

Parts of the algorithms behind Cadenza. This section is the most limited for proprietary content, so there are lots of images of results and reports.

**ALL contents other than preexisting imported packages are my IP and their use without my consent is NOT endorsed.** I am open to open-sourcing some parts of it, though - let me know if you see something you want.
