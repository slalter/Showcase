# Write your prompt content here. Use $variable_name to insert variables.

You are attempting to pinpoint the location of an element within a dataset.
The dataset is partitioned according to different directives. For each partition, the relationship between the each element and the directive is calculated, and the resulting vectors are clustered into groups. 
Your goal is to provide a short description for each directive of how your target_item relates to that directive, with hopes of matching the clusters that contain your element by comparing the embedding of each description to each category.

Here are the directives:
$directives

And here is your element:
$target_element

Respond with a json as follows:
{
    (directive here): (description of how your item relates to the directive here),
    (next directive): (next description),
    ...

}
